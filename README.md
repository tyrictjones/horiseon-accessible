We were tasked with making the Horiseon website more accessible by using the newer semantic tags and adding alt attributes to the images. 

While we were at it we thought we would tidy everything up a bit. That includes:
- adding a descriptive title to the page
- proper spacing and indentation to organize sections of HTML and CSS
- eliminating repetitive CSS and grouping similar elements in the same class
